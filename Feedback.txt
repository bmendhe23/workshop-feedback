Today's Git-Workshop was vary fascinating. Bhushan your teaching style is very great because of which I understood almost everything you taught and the OSOC members are very helpful and kind they helped me whenever i got stuck. Since I'm an Open Source Enthusiast I very much enjoyed it learning for the first time.

The summary of what I learned today -

1. How to initialize a local directory as git repo.
2. How to clone a remote repo from GitHub to my local system and how to make changes to it.
3. How to move file between 3 different states which are
  a. Modified
  b. Staged
  c. Committed
4. Different commands to manipulate files within repo.
5. Comparisons of Modified and staged files as well as comparisons of Staged and committed files.
6. Checking log of all previous commits.
7. Creating new branches, switching between branches, modifying them and merging them with the main branch.
8. About head and detached head and committed nodes & Jumping back to any previous node using it's hash Id and creating a branch from there and merging it.
9. About reverting, cleaning & resetting.
10. and Finally pushing updates to GitHub Repo.

And Everything was up to the mark.
