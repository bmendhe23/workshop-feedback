Today's git workshop was very informative.
I got to learn a lot today.
It was really a good initiative from OSOC club, unlike some of other clubs who taught us nothing neither they gave us enough time to learn.
Regardless of getting inducted in this club we have learn a lot.
During the workshop you made everything crisp and clear, the only drawback was the time. May be the workshop could have been conducted in two time slots so that we would have got some time to process everything we were learning. I understood starting topics very well but as we moved to the ending of the workshop everything was getting fast forwarded
