Hi,This is Balasainath.
My roll no. is 205122057.

And now coming to the workshop that has been conducted by OSOC on 08-10-2022 was fantabulous exempting the continuous interactive lecture.
But, I really appreciate Mr.Bushan for his long lasting explaination,though it  not only made me understood in easier way,
but it inspired me to talk like him in dias.And also many mentors of the workshop helped us alot, whenever and wherever we got stuck they
helped us by solving those issues.
                There were meagre loop holes too which can be corrected in future events,those are visibility issue:at starting it was good
and it's visible but after a while the font became little bit smaller due to that i was unable to see what was written in the board and i don't
wanted to interrupt the speaker.And at final moment to complete all the commands speaker has fastened the process of explaining at that time i was
unable to catch some points.
                Overall it was a good experience for me and i learnt something new in an easier way,i wish to learn more from you guys,hoping that
i will be inducted then i could explore more and contribute more to the club..!!


                                        *****~~~~~THANK YOU~~~~~*****
