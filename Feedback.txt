Hello,
The workshop on Git at Orion-G2 was very good.
The energy of students as well as osoc members was also very high.
Tutor(our senior) taught continuously for 3.5 hours just for us , so that we can get fimiliar with git and github.

The feedback which I can give is that Keep on doing this, because there is no problem which i faced . Location was easily accesible, clarity of concepts were there, osoc members were there to resolve any doubt.
so it was a accurate and perfect workshop in terms of fullness.
The only request which I can make is that the mic could be tested before because at that moment it was not working fine.
Overall good Experience.
Thank you
