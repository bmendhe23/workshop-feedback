First Of All Thanks To All OSOC Members for organising such a grateful session for us. Before Today’s Workshop I was totally unaware about Git-Hub and Git-Bash but
when Bhushan had started giving session all OSOC Members are helping us and make us comfortable and I was Gradually learning some new things.
	Specially i like the Bhushan’s  energy level that he was standing and giving session for more than 3 hours. With same energy level.
I think there was some negligible points like presentation visibility Issue and  Mic Problem , and in last Half an Hour we get overwhelmed  so didn’t get last few points.
But Overall workshop was fabulous and hope OSOP will organise such events in future for all students.
