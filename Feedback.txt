The coducted Git Workshop was very helpful to relearn some basic topics as well as getting to know about some new topics and their correct working.
A round of applause to the all the members of OSOC to coduct this event successfully.

The only improvement that I can think of is about providing the attendees prior pdf/ppt to have as a reference and having their respective pc setup prior to the workshop.
