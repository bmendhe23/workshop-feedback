The workshop organized by OSOC was one of the best I've attended till now.

I really loved the way, the speaker Mr. Bhusan Mendhe was trying to make everyone understand, by using diagrams, practically implementing it, etc.
The knowledge of speaker regarding the topic was top notch. 

I am also thankful to the team members for guiding us and resolving our doubts throughout the workshop.
Thanks again, all OSOC members!!
