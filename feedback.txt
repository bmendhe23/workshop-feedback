Totally enjoyed and learned a lot in a comfortable environment. 

The style and the knowledge of the presenter, bhushan, was totally amazing.
The teaching personally acknowledge and helped me to get some of my internal confidence and knowledgable works . 
I am happy to come in the workshop. The workshop was an experience in itself, unlike any other clubs (which I have had heard).
It is easy and enjoyable presentation.

Also T like the other club nmembers efforts to guide us when we get stuck anywhere.
Thanks a lot!üòç
