Hello,
I am Prasanjeet Karmakar.
My roll no is 205122064.
I am from Ranchi, Jharkhand.
I have completed Bachelor of Computer Application from St. Xavier's College, Ranchi.

The workshop was very helpful for me. I got to learn many things as I did not know prior to the workshop. The workshop provided more practical approach as even the theory part was explained practically.

I only hope that the workshop could have been longer or maybe taken in 2 days span as it is too much learning for a single day for us who have no prior knowledege.
Also the advanced topics such as branching or disbanded head could have been given more time to understand but then again we can just revise and understand it properly.

Overall the workshop was a great oppurtunity and I am thankful to all the 2nd year students for putting so much effort for guiding us. Thank You.
