Hello!
I am Shubhi Gupta.
My Roll No. is 205122095.

Now, About the today's workshop--

At First, I would like to mention that I have never used GITHUb or GIT , so this is a whole new experience for me ,
I would really like to Thank each and every member of OSOC Club for conducting such a good Workshop.
I have learned a lot of new things today and they have catched my interest in GIT and GITHUB so much, that 
I am really moving forward to learn more things about the GIT and GITHUB.

The speaker of today's workshop is so good in this field and it can also be seen from his way of explaining 
each and everything.


But there is thing like I have learned many a new things but because it is a very long session, so at the end 
I have missed out many things.
I am just Suggesting that you may have divided the workshop into 2 days , so we can also practice the same and properly
get the benefit of the workshop.

But nevertheless, it is a good experience.

Thank You to OSOC Club.
