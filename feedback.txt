Enormous and most sincere thanks for the workshop today. Just loved it!

Thank you Team OSOC â€“ this was a fabulous session! it was marvellous ðŸ˜€

All the team worked hard and helped us for getting comfortable with this version control system (GITHUB).

Bhushan is a great Tutor.
He explained very well about the git vs github all the other keys and their uses.
He very well tried to cover all the concepts but due to lake of time it can not be covered in that workshop but he provided us
links where we can find that missing concepts

And All the other persons helping us while we are stucking anywhere that thing i liked very much 
they all tried to go ahead with all the person (CS or Non-CS).

But their is always a room for improvement.

Thank you so much Once Again Team OSOC.
